## Version 0.1

> Caution: This is a developer preview. 

Since Theano package and Python2.7 are not updated in the future, and the configuration of dependences of orignal model is difficult, I changed to use Tensorflow/Keras and Python 3.6. 

A new model is trained (the data used in the training the model is identical as original). The model of this version is not well optimised. A better model will be release in few days.
